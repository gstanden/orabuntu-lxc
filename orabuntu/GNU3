#    Note that this software builds a containerized DNS DHCP solution (bind9 / isc-dhcp-server).
#    The nameserver should NOT be the name of an EXISTING nameserver but an arbitrary name because this software is CREATING a new LXC-containerized nameserver.
#    The domain names can be arbitrary fictional names or they can be a domain that you actually own and operate.
#    There are two domains and two networks because the "seed" LXC containers are on a separate network from the production LXC containers.
#    If the domain is an actual domain, you will need to change the subnet using the subnets feature of Orabuntu-LXC
